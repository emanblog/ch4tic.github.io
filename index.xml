      <description>What programming languages do you know?
I currently program in Python and C. I started learning Python back in 2018 and know it pretty well. When it comes to C I am not a master but do know it, have been learning it for about 3 months now.
Do you know Linux?
Yes! Linux is my favorite OS(currently using Ubuntu and Arch). Been using it for 3 years now and I am really skilled when it comes to just using the terminal.</description>
